/*
 * Lance Namespace Specification
 *
 * This OpenAPI specification is a part of the Lance namespace specification. It contains 2 parts:  The `components/schemas`, `components/responses`, `components/examples`, `tags` sections define the request and response shape for each operation in a Lance Namespace across all implementations. See https://lance.org/format/namespace/operations for more details.  The `servers`, `security`, `paths`, `components/parameters` sections are for the  Lance REST Namespace implementation, which defines a complete REST server that can work with Lance datasets. See https://lance.org/format/namespace/rest for more details.
