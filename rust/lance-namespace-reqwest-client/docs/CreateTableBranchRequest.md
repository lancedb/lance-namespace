# CreateTableBranchRequest

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**identity** | Option<[**models::Identity**](Identity.md)> |  | [optional]
**context** | Option<**std::collections::HashMap<String, String>**> | Arbitrary context as key-value pairs. How to use the context is custom to the specific implementation.  On a request, it carries caller-provided context to the implementation. On a response, it carries implementation-provided context back to the caller.  REST NAMESPACE ONLY Context entries are mapped to and from HTTP headers using the `header.` prefix: - On a request, any entry whose key starts with `header.` is sent as an HTTP   request header with the prefix stripped. For example, the entry   `{\"header.Authorization\": \"Bearer abc\"}` is sent as the request header   `Authorization: Bearer abc`. - On a response, every HTTP response header is returned as an entry whose key is the   header name prefixed with `header.`. For example, the response header   `x-request-id: abc123` is returned as the entry `{\"header.x-request-id\": \"abc123\"}`.  | [optional]
