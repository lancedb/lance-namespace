## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
|------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
|**identity** | [**Identity**](Identity.md) |  |  [optional] |
|**context** | **Map&lt;String, String&gt;** | Arbitrary context as key-value pairs. How to use the context is custom to the specific implementation.  On a request, it carries caller-provided context to the implementation. On a response, it carries implementation-provided context back to the caller.  REST NAMESPACE ONLY Context entries are mapped to and from HTTP headers using the &#x60;header.&#x60; prefix: - On a request, any entry whose key starts with &#x60;header.&#x60; is sent as an HTTP   request header with the prefix stripped. For example, the entry   &#x60;{\&quot;header.Authorization\&quot;: \&quot;Bearer abc\&quot;}&#x60; is sent as the request header   &#x60;Authorization: Bearer abc&#x60;. - On a response, every HTTP response header is returned as an entry whose key is the   header name prefixed with &#x60;header.&#x60;. For example, the response header   &#x60;x-request-id: abc123&#x60; is returned as the entry &#x60;{\&quot;header.x-request-id\&quot;: \&quot;abc123\&quot;}&#x60;.  |  [optional] |
|**id** | **List&lt;String&gt;** |  |  [optional] |
|**location** | **String** |  |  |
|**mode** | **String** | There are two modes when trying to register a table, to differentiate the behavior when a table of the same name already exists. Case insensitive, supports both PascalCase and snake_case. Valid values are:   * Create (default): the operation fails with 409.   * Overwrite: the existing table registration is replaced with the new registration.  |  [optional] |
|**properties** | **Map&lt;String, String&gt;** | Properties stored on the table, if supported by the implementation.  |  [optional] |
