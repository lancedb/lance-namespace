# Lance Namespace Specification

**Lance Namespace Specification** is an open specification on top of the storage-based Lance data format
to standardize access to a collection of Lance tables (a.k.a. Lance datasets).
It describes how a metadata service like Apache Hive MetaStore (HMS), Apache Gravitino, Unity Catalog, etc.
should store and use Lance tables, as well as how ML/AI tools and analytics compute engines
(will together be called _"tools"_ in this document) should integrate with Lance tables.

## Namespace Concepts

### Namespace Definition

A Lance namespace is a centralized repository for discovering, organizing, and managing Lance tables.
It can either contain a collection of tables, or a collection of Lance namespaces recursively.
It is designed to encapsulates concepts including namespace, metastore, database, schema, etc.
that frequently appear in other similar data systems to allow easy integration with any system of any type of object hierarchy.

Here is an example layout of a Lance namespace:

### Parent & Child

We use the term **parent** and **child** to describe relationship between 2 objects.
If namespace A directly contains B, then A is the parent namespace of B, i.e. B is a child of A.
For examples:

- Namespace `ns1` contains a **child namespace** `ns4`. i.e. `ns1` is the **parent namespace** of `ns4`.
- Namespace `ns2` contains a **child table** `t2`, i.e. `t2` belongs to **parent namespace** `ns2`.

### Root Namespace

A root namespace is a namespace that has no parent.
The root namespace is assumed to always exist and is ready to be connected to by a tool to explore objects in the namespace.
The lifecycle management (e.g. creation, deletion) of the root namespace is out of scope of this specification.

### Object Name

The **name** of an object is a string that uniquely identifies the object within the parent namespace it belongs to.
The name of any object must be unique among all other objects that share the same parent namespace.
For examples:

- `cat2`, `cat3` and `cat4` are all unique names under the root namespace
- `t3` and `t4` are both unique names under `cat4`

### Object Identifier

The **identifier** of an object uniquely identifies the object within the root namespace it belongs to.
The identifier of any object must be unique among all other objects that share the same root namespace.

Based on the uniqueness property of an object name within its parent namespace,
an object identifier is the list of object names starting from (not including) the root namespace to (including) the object itself.
This is also called an **list identifier**.
For examples:

- the list identifier of `cat5` is `[cat2, cat5]`
- the list identifier of `t1` is `[cat2, cat5, t1]`

The dot (`.`) symbol is typically used as the delimiter to join all the names to form an **string identifier**,
but other symbols could also be used if dot is used in the object name.
For examples:

- the string identifier of `cat5` is `cat2.cat5`
- the string identifier of `t1` is `cat2.cat5.t1`
- the string identifier of `t3` is `cat4$t3` when using delimiter `$`

### Name and Identifier for Root Namespace

The root namespace itself has no name or identifier.
When represented in code, its name and string identifier is represented by an empty or null string,
and its list identifier is represented by an empty or null list.

The actual name and identifier of the root namespace is typically
assigned by users through some configuration when used in a tool.
For example, a root namespace can be called `cat1` in Ray, but called `cat2` in Apache Spark,
and they are both configured to connect to the same root namespace.

## Namespace Operations

The Lance Namespace Specification defines a list of operations that can be performed against any Lance namespace:

| Operation ID        | Description                                                                                                        |

### Operation Versioning

There is no versioning concept within an operation. When backwards incompatible change is introduced,
a new operation needs to be created, with a naming convention of `<operationId>V<version>`,
for example `ListNamespacesV2`, `DescribeTableV3`, etc.

### Operation Request and Response Schema

Each operation has a request and response.
The request and response schema is defined using JSON schema in the `components/schemas` section of [rest.yaml](rest.yaml).

## Namespace Implementations

A **Lance Namespace Implementation** is an implementation of the Lance namespace specification,
more specifically:

1. It satisfies all the Lance namespace definitions and concepts.
2. It declares and implements a list of supported Lance namespace operations.

### Implementation and Storage

Except for any storage-only implementation (e.g. [Lance directory namespace](#lance-directory-namespace)),
a Lance table exists both in the storage and the implementation.
For example, a Lance table exists both in HMS and storage for the [Lance HMS namespace](#lance-hms-namespace).
There are 2 possible ways to manage a Lance table under such setting.
A Lance namespace implementation can choose to support one or both:

#### Implementation Managed Table

A implementation managed Lance table is a table that is fully managed by the Lance namespace implementation.
The implementation must maintain information about the latest version of the Lance table.
Any modifications to the table must happen through the implementation.
If a user directly modifies the underlying table in the storage bypassing the implementation,
the implementation must not reflect the changes in the table to the namespace users.

This mode ensures the namespace service is aware of all activities in the table,
and can thus fully enforce any governance and management features for the table.

#### Storage Managed Table

A storage managed Lance table is a table that is fully managed by the storage
with a metadata definition in the Lance namespace implementation.
The implementation only contains information about the table directory location.
It is expected that a tool finds the latest version of the Lance table based on the contents
in the table directory according to the Lance format specification.
A modification to the table can happen either directly against the storage,
or happen as a request to the implementation, where the implementation is responsible for applying the corresponding
change to the underlying storage according to the Lance format specification.

This mode is more flexible for real world ML/AI workflows
but the implementation loses full visibility and control over the actions performed against the table,
so it will be harder to enforce any governance and management features for storage managed tables.

## Tool Integration Guidelines

The following are guidelines for tools to integrate with Lance namespaces.
Note that these are recommendations rather than hard requirements.
The goal of these guidelines is to offer a consistent user experience across different tools.

### Configuring the Implementation

We recommend tools to offer a `impl` config key that allows user to configure the Namespace implementation.
We recommend the following values for the natively supported implementations:

| Implementation        | `impl` Value |
|-----------------------|--------------|
| Directory             | dir          |
| Apache Hive MetaStore | hive         |
| REST                  | rest         |

### Configuring an Implementation Details

We recommend tools to offer implementation specific configurations using the `impl` value as the config key prefix.
For example, all config keys for the directory namespace should start with `dir.`, like `dir.path`.
